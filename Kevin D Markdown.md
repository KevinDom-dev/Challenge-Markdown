## You can always count on me when

You need help with something I know of, you need a good book recommendation or if you need to be distracted with lots of otherwise useless little factoids on a variety of different subjects

## A funny story

As a child, I didn't know all words yet so I tried to fit the things I saw with the words I already knew. This led to the creation of things like "Leg Sleeve" for pants leg.

### TL;DR

Leg sleeves are a valid name which should be adopted worldwide
